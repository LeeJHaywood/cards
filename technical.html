   <h3>Introduction</h3>
   <p>
    This is a technical document outlining the methods used to encode and
    secure messages using a standard pack of playing cards.
   </p>
   <p>
    Messages are encoded and decoded using JavaScript in the web browser.&nbsp;
    Neither passwords nor messages are transmitted from the computer on which
    the page is loaded.&nbsp; Use of the page is not logged by the author,
    although the company hosting the web site may record visitor
    information.&nbsp; Encoding messages in a pack of playing cards provides
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plausible_deniability#Use_in_cryptography"
       title="Plausible deniability" target="_blank">plausible deniability</a>,
    provided that you always use a password and use your web browser's
    incognito / private browsing mode to avoid having these web pages in your
    browsing history.&nbsp; Note that hiding the introduction creates a
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP_cookie"
       title="HTTP cookie" target="_blank">cookie</a>.
   </p>
   <p>
    Every message that is encoded is checked against the decoder, so you can be
    confident that the recipient will be able to decode the message from the
    cards that are displayed.
   </p>
   <p>
    Card images are pre-loaded when the page loads, but it is still possible
    for there to be a delay when the cards are re-displayed as you type.&nbsp;
    To ensure that only an up-to-date selection is used, the cards are hidden
    and a pink background is shown whenever an image is being reloaded.&nbsp;
    Therefore, it should be apparent to you when the correct sequence has been
    fully displayed.
   </p>
   <h3>Password processing</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     In all cases, hashes based on the password are used to re-order the cards
     before assigning numbers to them.
    </li>
    <li>
     When using both sides of the cards, bit-level encryption is applied to the
     whole message before it is converted to a sequence of cards (see below).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Short messages could conceivably expose information about the password, as
    unused cards would be essentially the same for each short message.&nbsp; To
    counter this, the cards are re-arranged after each card that is selected
    when encoding the message.
   </p>
   <p>
    Passwords are
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Salt_(cryptography)"
       title="Cryptographic salt" target="_blank">salted</a> and
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Key_stretching"
       title="Key stretching" target="_blank">key strengthening</a> is applied
    using the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" title="SHA-2 set"
       target="_blank">SHA-256</a> algorithm.&nbsp; SHA-256 has about
    <a href="http://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=%282%5E256%29%2F%2852%21%29"
       title="(2^256)/(52!)" target="_blank">1,435 million</a> times more
    combinations than a pack of playing cards, so every password should
    correspond to a unique shuffle of the pack.
   </p>
   <h3>Encoding process</h3>
   <blockquote>
    See: <a href="mega-int.js">Large integer library</a>
    (JavaScript)&nbsp;&ndash; simple alternative to BigInt
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    Each message is converted into a single, large integer by successively
    multiplying by 256 and then adding each byte value.&nbsp; Encoding part of
    the result with the first playing card simply involves dividing this number
    by 52 (or 104 if using both sides) and taking the remainder.&nbsp; The left
    over part of the number is divided by the consecutively smaller number of
    available cards&nbsp;&ndash; e.g. from 51 down to 1&nbsp;&ndash; until
    either a zero result is reached or all cards have been used.
   </p>
   <p>
    When the checkbox is ticked to indicate that all cards should be used, any
    left over cards are used to encode zeros.
   </p>
   <h3>Encoding using one side</h3>
   <p>
    When all cards are required to be the same way up, as a pack of playing
    cards normally would be, the number of combinations is equivalent to
    225 bits of information.
   </p>
   <p>
    This corresponds to <b>28</b> 8-bit bytes with <b>one spare bit</b>.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The spare bit is used to indicate if both sides are being used or not, so
     is always zero (0) in this case.
    </li>
    <li>
     Text is always compressed using pair compression (see below).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <h3>Encoding using both sides</h3>
   <p>
    When cards are allowed to be either face up or face down, to provide 52
    bits of extra information, the number of combinations is equivalent to 277
    bits of information.
   </p>
   <p>
    This corresponds to <b>34</b> 8-bit bytes with an extra <b>5 bits</b> that
    are used as follows.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>
     The lowest bit is used to indicate if both sides are being used or not, so
     is always one (1) in this case.
    </li>
    <li>
     The second lowest bit is used to indicate if all cards are to be flipped,
     which happens to ensure that no more than half of all cards are flipped
     for any given result&nbsp;&ndash; saving the user effort.&nbsp; Since the
     range of values encoded by the first card (either 52 or 104 possibilities)
     is divisible by 4, this bit can be checked before trying to decide if the
     the whole pack is expected to be flipped or not.
    </li>
    <li>
     The third lowest bit is used to indicate if pair compression has been
     used.&nbsp; For some messages, pair compression incurs a penalty because
     (non-ASCII) Unicode characters/sequences have to be escaped (see below).
    </li>
    <li>
     The fourth lowest bit is used to indicate if UTF-8 encoding has been used
     rather than Unicode (the shortest is used, if either is more efficient
     than pair compression for a given message).
    </li>
    <li>
     The fifth bit is always set by the current encoder to indicate that
     bit-level encryption has been used (see known issues, below).
    </li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    There are 3 possible encoding methods, indicated by the third/fourth bits
    described above.
   </p>
   <ul>
    <li>Pair compression with escaped 2-byte Unicode characters</li>
    <li>Uncompressed 2-byte Unicode characters</li>
    <li>Uncompressed UTF-8 sequences (i.e. multi-byte characters)</li>
   </ul>
   <p>
    Unicode characters that fall outside of the
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plane_%28Unicode%29"
       title="Unicode planes" target="_blank">Basic Multilingual Plane</a>
    (BMP), e.g. the U+1D306 tetragram for centre (&#119558;),
    are supported indirectly.&nbsp; The web browser typically treats them as a
    pair of 2-byte Unicode characters (a surrogate pair) and the
    encoder/decoder handles them the same as any pair of Unicode characters.
   </p>
   <p>
    Even though the encoding gives a different result when the user indicates
    that both sides are to be used, it is possible&nbsp;&ndash; especially for
    short messages&nbsp;&ndash; that the selection given by the encoder will
    result in all cards being face up by chance.&nbsp; The second bit,
    described above, ensures that the decoder knows which scheme was used.
   </p>
   <p>
    Bit-level encryption is applied to the message before it is encoded
    (see below).&nbsp; In addition, the cards themselves are re-arranged prior
    to the encrypted message being assigned to them.
   </p>
   <h3>Pair compression</h3>
   <blockquote>
    See: <a href="pair-compress.js">Pair compression library</a>
    (JavaScript)&nbsp;&ndash; alternative to Smaz
   </blockquote>
   <p>
    By default, the pair compression algorithm expects "printable"
    <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ASCII"
       title="ASCII character encoding scheme" target="_blank">ASCII</a>
    characters (byte codes 32 to 126) to make up most of the message, which
    works very well for short messages in English (better than Smaz for most
    regular text) and with some success for other Western European
    languages.&nbsp; If not compressed, normal ASCII values are used.
   </p>
   <p>
    159 codes are used to represent common pairs of English characters, using
    byte values from 0-31 and 128-254 - for example, 177 is used to represent
    the common pair of letters &quot;<tt>th</tt>&quot;.
   </p>
   <p>
    A single non-ASCII character is escaped using a byte value of 127 followed
    by the Unicode value as 2 bytes.&nbsp; Multiple non-ASCII characters are
    escaped with a byte value of 255, followed a byte representing the number
    of characters (the count minus one) and then each of the 2-byte Unicode
    characters.&nbsp; Less common ASCII control codes&nbsp;&ndash; for tabs,
    line feeds, etc.&nbsp;&ndash; are treated as Unicode byte pairs.
   </p>
   <p>
    The dictionary of pairs was created by checking the frequencies of
    character pairs found in sample text from a selection of short stories and
    a set of SMS text messages.&nbsp; The pair frequencies were ranked from
    each source and the ranks combined to find those common to both types of
    text.
   </p>
   <h3>Bit-level encryption</h3>
   <p>
    When both sides of the cards are used, the message is split into individual
    binary digits (bits) and these are encrypted.&nbsp; For each of 3 rounds
    of encryption, the bits are psudo-randomly
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution_cipher"
       title="Substitution_cipher" target="_blank">flipped</a> and 
    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Substitution-permutation_network"
       target="_blank">rearranged</a> using a sequence of hashes based on the
    password.
   </p>
   <p>
    This is not necessary when only one side of the cards is used.&nbsp;
    Bit-level encryption was introduced to address a flaw in the original
    application (see known issues, below).
   </p>
   <h3>Known issues</h3>
   <ul>
    <li>
     <b>Resolved</b>:
     The original version of this application displayed numeric values at the
     bottom of the page which directly correspond to the original message, i.e.
     before the password is applied, but this was not clear to the user.&nbsp;
     These values are now hidden by default&nbsp;&ndash; a checkbox can be used
     to reveal them, in which case a warning is given.<br>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>Resolved</b>:
     The original version of this application did not handle some messages that
     ended with 'su', which is encoded as a zero value by pair
     compression.&nbsp; The encoder has been amended to remove all trailing
     spaces but will then add a single space to any message ending with 'su',
     which is then removed by the decoder.<br>&nbsp;
    </li>
    <li>
     <b>Resolved</b>:
     The original version of this application leaked a small amount of
     information about the message when both sides of the cards were used.&nbsp;
     Changing the password resulted in a different sequence of cards as
     expected&nbsp;&ndash; however, the individual cards that were
     flipped&nbsp;/ not flipped remained the same.&nbsp; In other words, which
     cards were flipped depended solely on the original message and not the
     password.&nbsp; The current encoder encrypts the message itself when both
     sides are used and the updated decoder automatically detects which version
     of the encoder was used.
